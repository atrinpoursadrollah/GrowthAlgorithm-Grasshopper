# GrowthAlgorithm-Grasshopper
Grasshopper project generating form using growth algorithm
This repository contains a **Grasshopper definition** that simulates procedural growth patterns and generates dynamic geometries. The project is inspired by natural growth processes and uses the **Weaverbird plugin** for mesh manipulation and smoothing. Itâ€™s ideal for **computational design experiments** and **architectural form exploration**.

## Features
- Pure Grasshopper visual scripting (no Python required).  
- Utilizes **Weaverbird plugin** for mesh smoothing, subdivision, and refinement.  
- Generates branching and organic growth patterns based on iterative rules.  
- Adjustable parameters for growth direction, length, and iterations.  
- Exportable results for further modeling or analysis.

## Usage
1. Open Rhino and Grasshopper.  
2. Make sure the **Weaverbird plugin** is installed.  
3. Open the file `Growth-Algorithm-script.gh`.  
4. Adjust input parameters as desired.  
5. Run the simulation to see the growth pattern develop in real time.
